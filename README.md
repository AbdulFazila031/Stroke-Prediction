# Stroke-Prediction
I developed a Virtual Health Assistant integrated with a Telegram Bot, powered by a GPT-2-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to help users assess the risk of stroke based on their symptoms. This assistant allows users to interact conversationally through the Telegram app, where they can describe their symptoms and receive AI-generated responses indicating potential stroke risk.

The model is fine-tuned on a medical dataset focused on stroke-related indicators and is designed to deliver informative and context-aware replies. The system is built using Python, GPT-2, and the Telegram Bot API, enabling seamless, real-time interaction through a simple and accessible interface.

Key Features
GPT-2-based chatbot for predicting stroke risk from symptom descriptions

Integrated with Telegram for easy user access and real-time conversation

Custom-trained model on stroke-related medical data for reliable response generation

Encourages early awareness and promotes preventive healthcare

Technologies Used
Python

GPT-2 (fine-tuned)

Telegram Bot API

NumPy, Pandas (data handling)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on your training framework)

Impact
This assistant provides a quick and accessible way for users to understand potential stroke symptoms, especially in underserved or remote regions. It reduces reliance on medical intermediaries for basic information and promotes early action through AI-powered awareness.
